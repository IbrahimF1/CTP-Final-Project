      "Plant Name": "Aloe Blush",
      "Light Requirements": "Prefers bright indirect light to full sun. Insufficient light causes leaves to droop.",
      "Watering": "Water when soil is completely dry. Water thoroughly until it drains out; discard excess water.",
      "Humidity Preferences": "Does not require extra humidity; tolerates dry air.",
      "Temperature Range": "65-75°F",
      "Feeding Schedule": "Feed once in spring and once in summer with liquid fertilizer for cacti/succulents.",
      "Toxicity": "Toxic to pets and humans if ingested.",
      "Additional Care": "Placing in full sun during late spring and summer may encourage soft-orange blooms. When outdoors, it requires more water. Wilting leaves indicate inadequate water."
